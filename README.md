# HaraldCS

It is a mod of Argentum Online (the first Argentinian MMORPG). Both the client and the server were made in VB6 by Pablo I. MÃ¡rquez. On that code, I made some changes to adapt it to an external server made by me in Java.

This server developed in Java takes care of login process, user privileges and their ranking by deaths. Moreover, it allows you to create multiple VB6 servers simultaneously.
